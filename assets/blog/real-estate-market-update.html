  <article>
    <p>The Omaha market continues to be active as we move into the fall season. Mortgage rates are higher than the lows seen a few years ago and still below the long term average, which creates a push and pull effect in buyer behavior. Some shoppers pause to recalibrate budgets while motivated buyers focus on value and move quickly on well prepared listings. Sellers who follow a smart launch plan are still seeing strong activity and solid contract terms.</p>

    <h2>Inventory is climbing but remains balanced</h2>
    <p>Active inventory has increased compared with last year, giving buyers more choice and adding a little breathing room during negotiations. Even with the rise, total months of supply in most price bands still sits within a balanced range. Entry level homes move the fastest, while luxury homes take longer and require a polished presentation plus market correct pricing.</p>

    <h2>Days on market is widening by a few days</h2>
    <p>Median days on market has expanded by several days versus the early summer pattern. This does not indicate a weak market. It reflects a more thoughtful pace where buyers conduct thorough tours, compare neighborhoods, and line up financing. Homes that are staged, pre inspected, and accurately priced still go under contract in the first week. Properties with unclear value or obvious repairs sit longer and invite price reductions.</p>

    <h2>What is happening by price band</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Under three hundred thousand:</strong> This segment remains competitive. Buyers should bring a strong approval letter, clear offer terms, and be prepared to act. Sellers should focus on turnkey presentation and quick response to questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Three hundred to five hundred thousand:</strong> This band shows balanced activity. Move in ready homes with outdoor space, updated kitchens, and flexible work areas get the most attention.</li>
      <li><strong>Above five hundred thousand:</strong> The pool of shoppers is more selective. Lifestyle features like proximity to trails, quality schools, and custom finishes drive value. Pricing should reflect recent closed sales rather than only list price averages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rates and payments: what to watch</h2>
    <p>Rates have moved within a narrow channel for most of the year. Weekly swings of a quarter point can change payments and therefore affordability bands. Serious buyers benefit from a conversation with a trusted lender about buydown options, lender credits, and locking at the right time. Sellers can widen the audience by offering a credit for closing costs or a temporary buydown when the numbers make sense.</p>

    <h2>Neighborhood trends we are tracking</h2>
    <p>Areas with quick access to major employers and fresh retail continue to outperform. Buyers value short commute times, walkable pockets, and homes with low maintenance improvements like modern windows and updated mechanicals. New construction draws interest where lots are scarce in the core, while established neighborhoods win when tree lined streets and character shine.</p>

    <h2>Five practical moves you can use now</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>For buyers:</strong> Ask your agent for a live value check on every target home using true comparable sales and pending data. Do not rely only on automated estimates.</li>
      <li><strong>For buyers:</strong> Write clean offers. Limit contingencies to essentials and confirm funds up front so the seller trusts your timeline.</li>
      <li><strong>For sellers:</strong> Order a pre list inspection. Fix the small items that spook buyers and disclose the rest with receipts. Confidence is marketable.</li>
      <li><strong>For sellers:</strong> Stage for photography. Crisp lighting, edited surfaces, and neutral color accents create a premium feel that adds perceived square footage.</li>
      <li><strong>For everyone:</strong> Watch the first seven days of market response. Showings and online saves in week one tell the truth about price and presentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bottom line for Fall 2025</h2>
    <p>The Omaha market rewards preparation. Buyers who secure approval, define must haves, and tour with intention are winning homes at fair prices. Sellers who correct condition issues, lead with strong visuals, and price to the most recent closed sales are moving in a predictable timeframe. Our team monitors daily activity across price bands and neighborhoods so you can move with confidence.</p>
